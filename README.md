# Calorie-Counter
Android app for CS180

Create a list of food and their respective calories for the day. Users can either search our database for food entries or create their own entry that gets added to the database.

TODO for Milestone 0 due Oct. 28:
- Lay out the RegisterUsers activity and make it register new users. 
- Let users change passwords.
- Let users query for similar entries, not exact only exact entries.
