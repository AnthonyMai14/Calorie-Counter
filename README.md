# Calorie-Counter
Android app for CS180

This application will facilitate the process of tracking caloric intake. This can be used to maintain certain caloric intake goals. This project has two parts:
- Design an Android or iOS client application which will allow the user to perform the following functions:
    - Query an online database for calorie totals for certain foods
    - Create a calorie goal
    - Track calorie consumption
- Create custom foods which can be uploaded to the online database by registered users.
  - An online database which maintains information for different foods. This should include:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Calorie Value


Milestone 0 Requirements:
- Database: Design the database and populate with at least 50 sample entries
- Basic GUI: A simple GUI which includes forms, buttons, and navigation bars.
- Queries: Allow the application to make queries from the database and retrieve calorie values
- Registration: Allow a user to register an account. Only registered users should be allowed to submit custom food to the database.
- Login/Logout: Allow for user authentication as well as “forgot username” and “forgot password” functionality.
- Password Update: Allow users to change their password.


Milestone 1 Requirements:
- GUI: Refine the GUI making it attractive and user-friendly
- Diet Tracker: Allow the user to create calorie goals and add consumed foods
- Custom Foods: Allow the the user to create their own custom foods and give them the option to upload the exercise to the database if the user is a registered user
- Progress Tracker: Implement calorie tracking, displaying the information in user-friendly graphs

TODO:
- Diet Tracker (Calorie limits and Daily logs)
- Progress Tracker (Warnings for getting close to calorie limits. Display caloric intake in graphs.)
